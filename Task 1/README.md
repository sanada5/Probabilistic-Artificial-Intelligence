This project has the goal of predicting pollution concentrations based on city area information using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. The key aspect of the project involves selecting the most appropriate kernel for the GP model, which is crucial for accurate predictions. To achieve this, the project employs model selection techniques by maximizing the marginal log-likelihood. Additionally, the dataset size is reduced using clustering techniques to enhance computational efficiency. The model utilizes city area features as predictors and fits the GP regressor to these features, incorporating a custom loss function that considers weighted costs for underprediction. This approach aims to provide accurate predictions of pollution concentrations across different city areas, particularly in regions with significant variations in pollution levels.
