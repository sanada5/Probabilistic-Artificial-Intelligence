Initially, the Stochastic Weight Averaging diagonal is implemented according to the pseudocode of the paper ‘A Simple Baseline for Bayesian Uncertainty in Deep Learning’. Afterwards, the full SWA is implemented (low rank + diagonal covarianve structure). The weights of this structure are adjusted and finally calibration Is performed by using temperature scaling, to control for ECE (expected calibration error).
