This project involves optimizing the structural features of a drug candidate to maximize its bioavailability (represented by $logP=f$) while ensuring it remains easy to synthesize (represented by synthetic accessibility, $SA=v$). Bayesian optimization is employed due to the lack of an analytical expression for the objective function and the constraint, which are only accessible through noisy evaluations. The optimization seeks to find the structural features, denoted as $x$, that maximize $logP$ while satisfying a constraint on SA ($v=SA < \kappa$, $\kappa$=4). The domain of the structural features is continuous within $[0, 10]$, and the objective and constraint are perturbed by Gaussian noise with specific standard deviations. Effective modeling of the mappings from structural features to logP and SA involves selecting appropriate kernels and lengthscale parameters. In order to tackle this goal, it is necessary to first specify the kernels used for the predictive function $(f)$ and the constraint function $(v)$. Afterwards, the Expected Improvement under Constraint (EIC) method is implemented, such that minimizing -EIC coincides with the goals of maximizing f while satisfying the constraint.
